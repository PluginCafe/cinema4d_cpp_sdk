/*
This is an example of a brush that is similar to the main Sculpting Pull Brush in Cinema4D.
This brush will move points along the normal that has been defined by the brush dab. The brush uses
all of the features of the sculpting system. It will handle Stamps, Stencils, Falloffs and Symmetry
automatically for you. All you need to do is define the single MovePointFunc method to tell the
sculpting system what to do for each point on a dab.
