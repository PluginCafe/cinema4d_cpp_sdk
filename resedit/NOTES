After several requests for ResEdit, MAXON decided to release the source code of ResEdit.
Just like everything else released by MAXON on GitHub, the entire project is under Apache license.

The source code is released as is. No special preparation was done prior to its release.
There won't be any support. You may use it as is. Maybe you can learn from it.
You may also improve it and fork from this project. If you feel like sharing your changes
with MAXON for reintegration, MAXON would certainly be grateful. But this is by no means a must.

The included project files are for VisualStudio 2012. The project got (superficially) tested
in Cinema 4D R16. Simply put the project folder into Cinema 4D's plugins folder (in program
directory) and load the ResEdit.sln into VisualStudio 2012.

Sincerely,
the MAXON SDK Support Team, 2015-08-13
